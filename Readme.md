# AI ASSISTED DEVOPS
What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI in DevOps involves using machine learning and other AI technologies to automate and optimize software development and delivery processes, enhancing speed, accuracy, and reliability throughout the software lifecycle. 

## Different types of AI
Traditional AI is an AI that holds historical data and uses to predict future outcomes. For example weather prediction. It predicts the temperature based on weather reports from the past.

Generative AI primary case use is to generate new content like text, images, videos. The input can be something you imagined and it generates a completely new content whether they be text, images and videos and llms

Large language models is focused on text generation and it is part of Generative AI e.g of llm are deepseek, chatgp, llama. They are trained using super computers 


Traditional AI in DevOps helps in observability and instance management, logistics management, auto scaling and report any incidence that can occur future


Generative AI in DevOps can be used to create a new kubrrnetes Manifest

3. AI assistance 
4. Scripting/programming language 


## Task 1

Create a shell script where the script should analyse the health of the virtual machine based on cpu, memory and disk space. if any of these three things are less than 60% utilized. The script declares the state of VM as healthy whereas if any of these parameters are more than 60%, script declares the health as non-healthy.

Also the script should support a command line argument named "explain" when passed the script should explain the reason for health status along with printing the health status.
